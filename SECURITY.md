# Security Policy

These automatic builds are based on latest revisions of Scarb and Cairo compiler.
We do our best to ensure their safety, but due to their unattended nature Scarb team
does not support and will not provide security updates for nightly builds.

In other cases, please follow [Scarb Security Policy](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/security/policy).
