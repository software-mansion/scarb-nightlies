<h1 align="center">Scarb Nightlies</h1>

This repository stores nightly builds of Scarb.
They are built on top of Scarb's and Cairo compiler's latest `main` branches.
Consult release notes for exact commit hashes and more information.
Each build is identified by calendar day it was produced, and are tagged in the following
pattern: `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD`, for example: `nightly-2023-08-03`.

These builds are created automatically, unattended.
**Use at your own risk.**
